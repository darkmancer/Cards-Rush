My first game on webpage and first project with writing with Javascrpit ever. Had been working on this for several hours. Passing through the struggle and frustration. Any suggestions feel free to inform. I would love to hear.

## Game Rules

Flip the hidden cards and match them (You know).

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
* The more you move the less rating you get.


## Technical

This project consists of the following assets:

* **index.html**  - contains the game's html structure.
* **main.css** - contains the game's board styling.
* **app.js** - contains all the board actions & logic.
